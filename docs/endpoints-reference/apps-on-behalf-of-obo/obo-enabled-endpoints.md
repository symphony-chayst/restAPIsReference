# API Endpoints for Apps

### Get Started with OBO

OBO or On-Behalf-Of authentication allows an extension application to be able to call REST API endpoints to perform operations on behalf of an application end-user.

Such operations include:

* List the streams of a given user
* Initiate connection requests to and determine connection status with other users
* Get the presence state of other connected users
* Initiate IMs and MIMs with other users
* Send messages and attachments
* Set the context user's own presence

## API endpoints enabled for OBO

The following table describes which of our REST API endpoints are OBO-enabled, and for each the application permission that must be granted to the app.

> ðŸš§ All OBO endpoints respect any existing entitlements or state for the user in session.
>
> For instance, if a user is not already connected to another user, an app cannot send a message to the second user on behalf of the first. Another example is that if a user does not have the "Can Send Files" entitlement in Symphony, an app cannot send a message containing an attachment on behalf of the user.
