> ðŸ“˜ ackId

> The `ackId` sent as a parameter can be empty in the first call. In the response, an `ackId` will be sent back and it can be used for the next call. This way, you acknowledge that you have received the events that came with that `ackId` and that the datafeed will remove the events associated with that `ackId` from your queue.
