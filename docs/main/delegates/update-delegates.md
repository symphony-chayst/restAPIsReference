# Update User Delegates

{% swagger src="../../.gitbook/assets/pod-api-public.yaml" path="/v1/admin/user/{uid}/delegates/update" method="post" expanded="true" fullWidth="true" %}
[pod-api-public.yaml](../../.gitbook/assets/pod-api-public.yaml)
{% endswagger %}

As the example shows, the action to be performed (`ADD` or `REMOVE`) and the user to be added or removed as a delegate (specified by user ID) must be included in the data parameter.
