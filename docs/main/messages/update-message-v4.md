* For authentication, you must either use the `sessionToken` that was created for delegated application access, or both the `sessionToken` and `keyManagerToken` together.

> #### ðŸ“˜ Controlled Availability
>
> Message Update is currently released with **Controlled Availability** because of the following limitations:
>
> * This feature is not yet supported on **Mobile**, where updates are displayed as new messages instead of replacing the existing one.
> * The flag `silent=false`, that can be used to make an update be displayed as an unread message, is not fully supported yet.
>
> Both limits will be lifted in a future release.

> #### ðŸš§ Permissions and guidelines
>
> * Entitlement `canUpdateMessage` is required.
> * Wall posts cannot be updated.
> * It is not possible to update messages sent by other users (except when using OBO with the proper permissions)
> * There is no time limit to update old messages, however we discourage updating very old messages as this won't provide a good user experience.
> * There is no limit of how many times a message can be updated, but we discourage updating it more than a 1000 times.
> * When used as a OBO endpoint, the end user must have the `canUpdateMessage` entitlement enabled, and the App must have the `SEND_MESSAGES` permission.
