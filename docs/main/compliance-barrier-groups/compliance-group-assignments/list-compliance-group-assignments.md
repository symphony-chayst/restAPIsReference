> #### ðŸš§ Roles and Privileges
>
> Calling this endpoint requires the **Scope Management** role.\
> See [Bot Permissions](https://docs.developers.symphony.com/building-bots-on-symphony/configuration/bot-permissions) for a list of roles and associated privileges.

> #### ðŸ“˜ Limit
>
> Query parameter `limit`: A query may return fewer than the value of limit due to filtering or service-side maximums. Do not depend on the number of results being fewer than the limit value to indicate your query reached the end of the list of data, use the absence of next instead.\
> For example, if you set the limit to 10 and only 9 results are returned, there may be more data available, but one item was removed due to privacy filtering. Some maximums for limit may be enforced for performance reasons.
