# Compliance Group Types

The Compliance User Groups section contains APIs that you can use for creating and maintaining [Compliance User Groups](compliance-user-groups/), [Compliance Group Assignments](compliance-group-assignments/) , and [Compliance Group Memberships](compliance-group-memberships/).

Some of the APIs under the Compliance User Groups section have a body parameter called `type` which is responsible for selecting certain types of compliance groups, changing the API behavior and consequently, the returned data.

The following list shows the currently available **compliance group types** that can be passed to the `type` attribute:

**â€¢ ROLE\_SCOPE**

The `ROLE_SCOPE` type uses groups of users to define the scopes of individual Super Compliance Officer or Compliance Officer, controlling what they can view and manage. A **Scope** is the range of accounts and conversations that a Super Compliance Officer or Compliance Officers are allowed to handle. The assignment of one or more compliance groups to an account creates a scope.

Compliance groups of type ROLE\_SCOPE can **only** be used when creating/managing the scope of Super Compliance Officers or Compliance Officers. These compliance groups cannot be used for any other purposes.

Note: other types of compliance groups will be available in the future.
