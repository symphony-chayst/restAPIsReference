### Connection Behaviour

Currently, there are four possible connection status:

* PENDING\_INCOMING: The specified user requested to connect with the calling user.
* PENDING\_OUTGOING: The calling user requested to connect with the specified user.
* ACCEPTED: The two users are connected.
* REJECTED: The two users are not connected.

The following table shows the connection current behaviors:

| Initial Connection Status | Request Action | New Connection Status                 |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ACCEPTED                  | Remove         | None (the connection no longer exist) |
| PENDING\_INCOMING         | Remove         | REJECTED                              |
| REJECTED                  | Remove         | PENDING\_INCOMING                     |
