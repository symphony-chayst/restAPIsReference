> #### ðŸ“˜ Note - Suspension
>
> Since 20.14, `userSystemInfo` from the payload includes suspension info:
>
> * if user is active, then the `suspended` attribute is set to false,
> * if user is suspended, then the `suspended` attribute is set to true and both `suspendedUntil` and `suspensionReason` are as well included in the payload.
>
> _Please note that even if the suspendedUntil date is in the past, the user will remain suspended=true until he first logs on the client after the suspension ended. The suspended info are then automatically updated._\
