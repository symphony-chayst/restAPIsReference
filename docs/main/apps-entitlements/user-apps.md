> This endpoint returns all enabled entitlements for a specific user, returning both the global and the custom settings.\
> Currently, it is not possible to identify by API response whether the returned entitlements are global or custom.
>
> To know more about how to modify an app entitlement per user, and how to reset the app entitlements for that user to the default global settings, refer to [Update User Apps](partial-update-user-apps.md)
