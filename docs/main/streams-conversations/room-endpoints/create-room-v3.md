> * Room names will be considered the same if they only differ in capitalization and whitespace. E.g. "room1" and "R O O M 1" are considered the same. Also, room names must be shorter than 50 characters.
> * `viewHistory`, `discoverable` and `membersCanInvite` attributes cannot be _false_ if `public=true`.
