> #### ðŸ“˜ Stream ID
>
> The stream ID can be located in the Symphony web or desktop client by clicking on the timestamp of any message in the conversation. This will open the Message Status module overlay, and the Conversation ID can be found in the overlay footer.
>
> The stream ID in the UI is in Standard Base64 encoding. When the stream ID needs to be used in a URL, it should be in URLSafe Base64 encoding. To obtain the URLSafe Base64 stream ID, replace forward slashes with underscores, replace pluses with minuses, and ignore any trailing equal signs.
